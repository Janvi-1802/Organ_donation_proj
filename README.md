Organ Donation management system 

-->Goal
The primary goal of this project is to facilitate organ donation and matching by providing an efficient platform for admins to manage donors and requestants, and for users to register as donors or requestants. The system will offer
comprehensive visibility into donor/requestant data, with a focus on matching organs and blood types to ensure compatibility and streamline the donation process.

-->Overview
This project is designed to enhance the process of organ donation by leveraging technology to manage and match donors and requestants efficiently. The platform caters to two types of users: admins and normal users. Admins have advanced
capabilities to view and manage data, while normal users can easily register themselves as donors or requestants.

Admin Capabilities:
View Donor and Requestant Lists: Admins can view comprehensive lists of all donors and requestants. This functionality provides a clear overview of available resources and current demands.

Filter by Organ: Admins can filter lists to view donors and requestants for specific organs. This helps in identifying available resources for specific organ transplants.

Matching Donors to Requestants: Admins can view the number of matching donors for a particular requestant based on organ type and blood type compatibility. This feature ensures that requestants are paired with suitable donors,
streamlining the donation process.

Add Donors and Requestants: Admins can add new donors and requestants directly through the platform, ensuring that all relevant information is captured and stored securely.
